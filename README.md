# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
### Step 1: 
we have to intialise program using import numpy to perform mathematical calculation
### Step 2: 
THe input from the user is stored in the variable a
### Step 3: 
Using the np.linalg.matrix_rank(), we can find the rank of the given matrix.
### Step 4:
end of the program
## Program:
#Program to find the rank of the matrix.
#Developed by: RAMYA R
